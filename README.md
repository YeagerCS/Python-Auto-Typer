# Python-Auto-Typer

## Description
This application works for the website https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/typing.
It takes a screenshot of the websites prompt that the user has to type. Then it reads everything in the screenshot and starts typing it out.
The design is not responsive, the coordinates of the screenshot depend on your laptop or monitor. Also the application requires the Tesseract-OCR package with the correct path.
