Giraffes are the tallest animals on Earth, and their neck is the reason why. This beautiful part of their body has many different purposes, from spotting predators to reaching the sweetest leaves, even being used to duel with other giraffes. Neck fighting can be intense, going from gently rubbing against another male to establish who's in charge, to swinging heads like a mace and hitting hard. But it's all in good sport! Giraffes will make up after most fights, rarely getting hurt in a serious way.
